This is a research project into whether or not it is feasible to enable
real time state output of a method while it is being written in a full
sized .NET project. The original idea for this comes from 
[Bret Victor's Inventing on Principle talk](http://vimeo.com/36579366).

There is currently a standalone prototype, and while this demos nicely,
it really doesn't prove that it's possible to enable this type of feature
on a full project. So the goal is to expand to multiple files, and eventually
a Visual Studio and MonoDevelop plugin.
